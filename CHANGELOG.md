# Changelog

## Unreleased
- reorganized the project into the requested folder structure (css/, js/, assets/, data/)
- split the previous `script.js` into focused modules for storage, filters, sorting, rendering, helpers, and data loading
- updated `index.html` to reference the new CSS/JS file locations and added persistent filter + sort state handling
